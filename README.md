# 1. Project Status
The project is currently underway with a deadline of 5th June 2021.
The index page is largly finished but needs testing.

# 2. User Story
## 2.1 The business case(Project Goals):
I was asked by my local gym Fitness First to create a wesbite for their gym. They have decided, that to increase the number of members using the gym, that they need a website with more information.
This website will be designed to give users more information about the gym known as "Fitness First". The website is aimed at users looking to join this gym and or get information on classes that they may find interesting.

Once the user has navigated the whole website they will have a better understanding of what the gym is, what it has to offer and be able to see some of its facilities. 

If they are then happy with the service the user will be able to join the gym using a form on a join page. 

The overal story would be as follows:
* Search for the gym (either via google or by entering the domain directly)
* Once loaded, the homepage will help the user understand the structure of the website, what pages it has and how to get more information
* The user can then chose between visiting the; Home page, Classes information page, gallery and Join page

## 2.3 Website Objectives:
* Increase the profile of the gym
* Entice new members to the website
* Provide users with more information on the gym and its facilities
* Encourage users to join the gym
* Help users find the gym

## 2.4 Design Inspiration
My main Inspiration for the website design can be credited to "https://www.fitnessfirst.co.uk/". I have tried to take the themes that I liked and apply them to my website. I particularly like the linear structrue of the site. With the key points displayed in clear, defined sections. The colour scheme was created through a combination of the existing branding as well as the branding I have seen attending my local gym.
I used an online website to get the colour code using the logo as a reference point.


# 3. Features
The website will be made up of a number of pages:

index.html - I.e. the home page. This landing page will be made of up of a number of naviagation options, made up of sections and will be used to promote the other pages

classes.html - A breakdown of all the available classes at the gym. 

gallery.html - The gallery page will provide a pictures of the gym facilities. 

join.html - The join page will give the user a map to the gym with a google maps link and a number of membership options to select from and a join form that they can fill out and submit to join. 




## 3.1 Existing Features
Feature 1 - Join us form. The form will allow the user to select the membership they would like and submit for approval.


## 3.2 Features Left to Implement
n/a


## 3.3 Technologies Used
HTML 5 - https://html.com/html5/

CSS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS

Bootstrap v5 (used as reference) - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/

Balsamiq Wireframes - https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/


# 4. Testing
## 4.1 Informal
Informal testing is and was conducted throughout the build. 

My method of testing is based on trial and error, something that I learnt through my time with VBA for MSOffice. I would write a line of code and check the outcome. Mostly working step by step.

The informal process of testing is as follows:
* Before code is written a new preview is opened
* Line/lines of code written
* Preview is opened and refreshed
* Desired outcome is checked
* Outcome is checked in a mobile phone layout using Chrome developer tools.
* If outcome is successful then wider checks on other code are conducted. For example, what impact does it have on other elements.
* If outcome is unsuccessful then the line/lines of code written will be checked and informal testing repeated.

## 4.2 Formal
To be conducted at the end of the creation phase. This will involve using websites to check formatting etc. This will then prompt the bug/format fixes.

# 5. Deployment
To be confirmed

# 6. Credits
## Content
Where needed source material is referenced below but also in the HTML page itself using comments. I have done it this way so that the referenced material can be easy to find within the code.

Thank you to:
https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpodify/ 
for references to using gitpod. Specifically openeing a preview.

https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project 
for help with this ReadMe.

Thank you especially to my mentor Marcel for the time and effort provided. Including during his weekend.

Where possible acknowledgements will be noted in the code.

# 7. Lessons learnt
## 7.1 Lessons
Understanding and implementing HTML/CSS has been easier than I thought it would be. Creating a basic website has been ok but implementing it has been challenging in places.

More practice projects and pushing the boundaries will help massively. Gaining experience will help. 

Need to plan the layout and content first. Not necessarily the "design" but what I actually want to do at a high level. See https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/website-planning-guide/

## 7.2 Future study points
Need to revisit the media screen size lesson. I understand the concept but not the application.
