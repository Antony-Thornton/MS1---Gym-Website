# 1. Project Status
The project is currently underway with a deadline of 5th June 2021.
The index page is largly finished but needs testing.

# 2. User Story
## 2.1 The business case(Project Goals):
I was asked by my local gym Fitness First to create a wesbite for their gym. They have decided, that to increase the number of members using the gym, that they need a website with more information.
This website will be designed to give users more information about the gym known as "Fitness First". The website is aimed at users looking to join this gym and or get information on classes that they may find interesting.

Once the user has navigated the whole website they will have a better understanding of what the gym is, what it has to offer and be able to see some of its facilities. 

If they are then happy with the service the user will be able to join the gym using a form on a join page. 

The overal story would be as follows:
* Search for the gym (either via google or by entering the domain directly)
* Once loaded, the homepage will help the user understand the structure of the website, what pages it has and how to get more information
* The user can then chose between visiting the; Home page, Classes information page, gallery and Join page

## 2.2 Wireframes

### SiteMap

![index web](documentation-assets/wireframe-images/site_map_wireframe.jpg)

### Mobile Wireframes

General layout

The general layout looks primarily at the heading/navigation secion as well as the footer. The website wireframes were desinged with a mobile first approach.
The idea behind this was so that when the screen size expands the elements will shift accordingly left and right as if being stretched.

Header

From top down the header will have; an advert link at the very top directing the user to join,
a division with the logo with a text below indicating the current page, it will then have a hero image that has a floating text based navigation box to the right and a floating text based box to the left with some placeholder text that helps the user understand the page.

Footer 

The footer will include a disclaimer explaining the webpage is based on a project for the code institute course. It will then have links to official Fitness First sources.

Main Body of text

The main body of text will be expanded in further wireframes due to the need for specificity.

Home Page layout

The home page main body will consist of; generic gym picture with a floating text box that shows the 4 classes that the gym has available; spinning, yoga, boxing and aquafit.
The text will be a mixture of HTML elements, namely P and H1-H6. Below this will be a number of pictures of current gym users. At the very bottom will be a picture, created in canva
showing the current membership options and linking to the join us page.

Classes Page layout

The classes page main body will be broken into 4 sections. One for each class. Within each section will be a header for the class in question, a description of the class and a HTML table 
of days and times. Each section will look the same and will be under each other on a mobile device and inline on a webpage.

Gallery Page Layout 

The gallery page will include 4 images of the gym facilities. It is designed to show case the gym facilities themselves.

Join Us Page Layout

The Join us page will include a section that includes an image of google maps allowing the user to see where the gym is located. It also includes a link to the 
google maps page the screenshot came from to allow the user to navigate from wherever they are based. Below this will be a section that includes all the membership options
and prices. Another floating text box below this will show a join us form with information required to join.

## 2.3 Website Objectives:
* Increase the profile of the gym
* Entice new members to the website
* Provide users with more information on the gym and its facilities
* Encourage users to join the gym
* Help users find the gym

## 2.4 Design Inspiration
My main Inspiration for the website design can be credited to "https://www.fitnessfirst.co.uk/". I have tried to take the themes that I liked and apply them to my website. I particularly like the linear structrue of the site. With the key points displayed in clear, defined sections. The colour scheme was created through a combination of the existing branding as well as the branding I have seen attending my local gym.
I used an online website to get the colour code using the logo as a reference point.


# 3. Features
The website will be made up of a number of pages:

index.html - I.e. the home page. This landing page will be made of up of a number of naviagation options, made up of sections and will be used to promote the other pages

classes.html - A breakdown of all the available classes at the gym. 

gallery.html - The gallery page will provide a pictures of the gym facilities. 

join.html - The join page will give the user a map to the gym with a google maps link and a number of membership options to select from and a join form that they can fill out and submit to join. 




## 3.1 Existing Features
Feature 1 - Join us form. The form will allow the user to select the membership they would like and submit for approval.


## 3.2 Features Left to Implement
n/a


## 3.3 Technologies Used
HTML 5 - https://html.com/html5/

CSS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS

Bootstrap v5 (used as reference) - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/

Balsamiq Wireframes - https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/


# 4. Testing
## 4.1 Informal Development Testing
Informal testing is and was conducted throughout the build. 

My method of testing is based on trial and error, something that I learnt through my time with VBA for MSOffice. I would write a line of code and check the outcome. Mostly working step by step.

The informal process of testing is as follows:
* Before code is written a new preview is opened
* Line/lines of code written
* Preview is opened and refreshed
* Desired outcome is checked
* Outcome is checked in a mobile phone layout using Chrome developer tools.
* If outcome is successful then wider checks on other code are conducted. For example, what impact does it have on other elements.
* If outcome is unsuccessful then the line/lines of code written will be checked and informal testing repeated.

Further testing including sending the website link to my partner who navigated the website on both her phone and tablet. This was useful as it flagged an
issue where pictures were not appearing on the home page.

## 4.2 Formal Deployment Testing
Need to be explicit.
Testing individual buttons/links etc

To be conducted at the end of the creation phase. This will involve using websites to check formatting etc. This will then prompt the bug/format fixes.

# 5. Deployment
The website will be deployed using GitHubs built in pages manager.

Step 1 - Log in to GitHub page

Step 2 - Navigate to project and click settings

Step 3 - In the bar on the left click pages

Step 4 - Under the source dropdown select main and click save

A link should appear above the source dropdown and look something like this

Your site is ready to be published at https://antony-thornton.github.io/MS1---Gym-Website/

## Content
Where needed source material is referenced below but also in the HTML page itself using comments. I have done it this way so that the referenced material can be easy to find within the code.

Thank you to:
https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpodify/ 
for references to using gitpod. Specifically openeing a preview.

https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project 
for help with this ReadMe.

Thank you especially to my mentor Marcel for the time and effort provided. Including during his weekend.

Where possible acknowledgements will be noted in the code.

# 7. Lessons learnt
## 7.1 Lessons
Understanding and implementing HTML/CSS has been easier than I thought it would be. Creating a basic website has been ok but implementing it has been challenging in places.

More practice projects and pushing the boundaries will help massively. Gaining experience will help. 

Need to plan the layout and content first. Not necessarily the "design" but what I actually want to do at a high level. See https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/website-planning-guide/

Need to push changes more frequently and appropriately. I.e when i make a small change to something like the height of an existing element.

## 7.2 Future study points
Need to revisit the media screen size lesson. I understand the concept but not the application.
