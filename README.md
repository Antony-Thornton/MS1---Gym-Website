# MS1---Gym-Website

# Fitness First Website (Members only Gym)

For more information please visit https://www.fitnessfirst.co.uk/. All content shared is the property of Fitness First.

# Project Status
The project is currently underway with a deadline of 5th June 2021.
The index page is largly finished but needs testing.

# UX


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

# Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

The website will be made up of a number of pages:

index.html - I.e. the home page. This landing page will be made of up of a number of naviagation options, made up of sections and will be used to promote the other pages
classes.html - A breakdown of all the available classes at the gym. 
gallery.html
join.html




## Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea

## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.


HTML 5 - https://html.com/html5/

CSS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS

Bootstrap v5 - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/

Balsamiq Wireframes - https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/


# Testing
Informal testing is and was conducted throughout the build. 

My method of testing is based on trial and error, something that I learnt through my time with VBA for MSOffice. I would write a line of code and check the outcome. Mostly working step by step.

The informal process of testing is as follows:
* Before code is written a new preview is opened
* Line/lines of code written
* Preview is opened and refreshed
* Desired outcome is checked
* Outcome is checked in a mobile phone layout using Chrome developer tools.
* If outcome is successful then wider checks on other code are conducted. For example, what impact does it have on other elements.
* if outcome is unsuccessful then the line/lines of code written will be checked and informal testing repeated.



In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form: Go to the "Contact Us" page Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears. In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

# Deployment
This project was created and deployed in GitHub and GitPod.

#Notes - Need help with deployment section

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)? Different configuration files? Separate git branch? In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

# Lessons learnt
## Lessons
Understanding and implementing HTML/CSS has been easier than I thought it would be. Creating a basic website has been ok but implementing it has been challenging in places.

More practice projects and pushing the boundaries will help massively. Gaining experience will help. 

Need to plan the layout and content first. Not necessarily the "design" but what I actually want to do at a high level. See https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/website-planning-guide/

## Future study points
Need to revisit the media screen size lesson. I understand the concept but not the application.
